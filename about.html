  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a tech enthusiast specializing in artificial intelligence, low-level
    programming, and hardware engineering. My work spans from building efficient
    neural network architectures to optimizing systems at the hardware level.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a background in computer science and electrical engineering, I bring a
    holistic approach to problem-solving, understanding systems from the
    transistor up to the algorithm.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently focused on AI acceleration techniques, optimizing compilers, and
    exploring the boundaries between traditional computing and quantum systems.
